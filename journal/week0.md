# Week 0 - Bilinng and Architecture 


## Introduction

- **Object Relational Mapping(ORM)** - Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used in creating a bridge or link between object-oriented programs and in most general cases Relational Databases.In object-oriented programming we have to perform various operations like creating, reading , updating and deleting (CRUD) data from a database, we usually use SQL queries to perform these operations in the database. Using ORM tools those SQL queries can be replaced with ORM tool functionality.

- **Monolithic & Microservice Architecute** - A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications.

A microservices architecture, also simply known as microservices, is an architectural method that relies on a series of independently deployable services. These services have their own business logic and database with a specific goal. Updating, testing, deployment, and scaling occur within each service. Microservices decouple major business, domain-specific concerns into separate, independent code bases

- **Iron Triangle** - Project managers work within three project constraints: budget, scope and schedule. Depending on the project or who is involved, each of these project constraints could be the most important to the end-user. Quality resides in the middle of the project triangle, and effective project managers must balance the ebb and flow of tradeoffs within these three constraints in order to achieve success. This longstanding model provides a dynamic way to approach priorities on a project and supports describing items of value in a project team

- **TOGAF** - TOGAF helps businesses align IT goals with overall business goals, while helping to organize cross-departmental IT efforts. The TOGAF framework is broken into two main groups, which include the TOGAF fundamental content and extended guidance. The fundamental content includes all the essentials and best practices of TOGAF that create the foundation for the framework. The extended guidance portion of TOGAF includes guidance for specific topics such as agile methods, business architecture, data and information architecture, and security architecture. The extended guidance portion of TOGAF is expected to evolve over time as more best practices are established, whereas the fundamental content offers a basic starting point for anyone looking to apply the framework.

- As suggested I have followed the Week 0 instructions and was able to successfully do the setup.For Jounral updation I am using VScode as it's easier to have local clone of Github repo and conitnously do updation in local repo  and finally doing few final pushes only in GtiHub.

- Details regarding the Instructions followed to create a Budget and a Biling alarm.
